    <h2>Further Information</h2>
    <p>
        We object to the use of the above information for the transmission of unsolicited advertising.<br>
        Distribution or publication of the contact details on other websites is expressly prohibited.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Liability for content</h2>
    <p>
        As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with<br>
        general law in accordance with Section 7 (1) of the German Telemedia Act. According to §§ 8-10 TMG<br>
        we are not obliged to examine transmitted or stored third-party information for illegal activities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However,<br>
        liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which we become aware of a specific<br>
        infringement of the law. After notification of the corresponding legal violations, we will remove the<br>
        relevant illegal content immediately.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Liability for links</h2>
    <p>
        Our offer contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. For<br>
        this reason we cannot accept any liability for the content of these external websites. The respective<br>
        provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        All linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time the links were created. For<br>
        all links, no illegal content was recognizable at the time of linking. A permanent content control<br>
        of the linked pages is not reasonable without evidence of a legal violation. If we become aware of<br>
        legal violations, we will of course remove such links immediately.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Copyright</h2>
    <p>
        The content and works on these pages created by the website operator are subject to German<br>
        copyright law. The duplication, distribution and utilization outside of the copyright limits<br>
        require the author's written consent. Downloads and copies of this website and its contents<br>
        are only permitted for private, but not for public use.
    </p>
    <p>
        As far as content on this site was not created by us, it will be marked as such and the copyrights<br>
        of third parties will be observed. If you notice a legal violation, we ask for information to remove the<br>
        content after becoming aware of legal violations.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Donations</h2>
    <p>
        Donations to us are to be regarded as gifts within the meaning of Section 7 ErbStG. All donors must have<br>
        reached the age of 18 at the time of their submission. Alternatively, the consent of the parents or legal<br>
        guardians must be available. An active verification of the age of each donor cannot be guaranteed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our community works fundamentally with no intention of making a profit. According to §8 ErbStG,<br>
        financial resources are only used for services that serve the community. There is no legal entitlement<br>
        to any consideration on our part for donations made.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Note in accordance with the online dispute resolution regulation</h2>
    <p>
        We are obliged to inform our users about the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/">European online dispute settlement platform</a> ("ODR"). This<br>
        platform can be used to settle disputes without the involvement of a court. We would like to point out<br>
        that we are neither obliged nor willing to participate in ODR proceedings.
