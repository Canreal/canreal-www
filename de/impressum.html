        <h2>Further Information</h2>
        <p>
            We object to the use of the above information for the transmission of unsolicited advertising.<br>
            Distribution or publication of the contact details on other websites is expressly prohibited.
        </p>
      
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Liability for content</h2>
        <p>
            As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with<br>
            general law in accordance with Section 7 (1) of the German Telemedia Act. According to §§ 8-10 TMG<br>
            we are not obliged to examine transmitted or stored third-party information for illegal activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However,<br>
            liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which we become aware of a specific<br>
            infringement of the law. After notification of the corresponding legal violations, we will remove the<br>
            relevant illegal content immediately.
        </p>
        
        <hr>

        <h2>Liability for links</h2>
        <p>
            Our offer contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. For<br>
            this reason we cannot accept any liability for the content of these external websites. The respective<br>
            provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            All linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time the links were created. For<br>
            all links, no illegal content was recognizable at the time of linking. A permanent content control<br>
            of the linked pages is not reasonable without evidence of a legal violation. If we become aware of<br>
            legal violations, we will of course remove such links immediately.
        </p>

            As far as content on this site was not created by us, it will be marked as such and the copyrights<br>
            of third parties will be observed. If you notice a legal violation, we ask for information to remove the<br>
            content after becoming aware of legal violations.

            financial resources are only used for services that serve the community. There is no legal entitlement<br>
